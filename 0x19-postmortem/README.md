## Introduction
This project focuses on understanding the concept of postmortems in the context of DevOps and SysAdmin, emphasizing the importance of learning from failures to improve systems and processes. The project involves writing a postmortem for an outage scenario and enhancing its readability.

## Concepts
The primary concept addressed in this project is:

- **On-call**: Understanding the process of handling system outages and incidents, including detection, escalation, resolution, and postmortem analysis.

## Background Context
In the tech industry, system failures are inevitable and can stem from various factors such as bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, or human error. Postmortems serve as a crucial tool for teams to analyze outages, understand their causes, and implement measures to prevent recurrence. The objectives of a postmortem include providing information to stakeholders about the outage's impact and ensuring that root causes are identified and addressed.
