# Web Stack Debugging #0

## Introduction
This project is part of the Web Stack Debugging series, which focuses on debugging skills for Full-Stack Software Engineers. The goal is to fix issues within a given web stack to bring it to a working state. In this specific project, we are tasked with getting Apache to run on a Docker container and return a page containing "Hello Holberton" when querying the root.

## Getting Started
Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project:

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine.
- Access to the internet to pull the required Docker image.

### Installation
1. Clone the project repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lelaabk/alx-system_engineering-devops.git
   cd 0x0D-web_stack_debugging_0
   ```

2. Execute the debugging script:
   ```bash
   ./0-give_me_a_page
   ```

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues running the script or have questions, consider the following:

- Ensure Docker is properly installed and the Docker daemon is running.
- Verify that your user is in the `docker` group to execute Docker commands without sudo.
- Check the status of the Docker container using `docker ps` after running the script.

## Additional Information
- This project is part of the curriculum at [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/).
- For more information on Docker, refer to the [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).
- Feel free to explore and modify the script based on your debugging approach.
