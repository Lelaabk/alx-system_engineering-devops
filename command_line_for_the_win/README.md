**The steps I followed to use the SFTP command-line tool in this project**

- I opened Command Prompt in the window.
- I opened page of Sandbox at alx intranet.
- I copied SFTP code in the bottun of SFTP.
- I pasted it in terminal of command prompt.
- I copied password of SFTP from page of sandbox.
- I pasted in the terminal.
- It worked it opened successfully.
- I was tsruggling for one hour until I found the right steps.
- First command is 'ls' to make sure that you opened server of alx
- Second one is 'lls' to show current directory of local machine.
- Third one is 'lcd \Pictures\Screenshots\' using lcd let you changing directories in your local machine.
- then I use the last command 'put' that transfer file to remote system from local machine.
- I did this 'put 0-0-first-9-tasks.png' and it works!
- Then I closed the terminal and I wend to server of sandbox of alx.
and I found them there and I moved them to the right place to folder of command-line-for-the-win.
